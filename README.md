# MachineLearning_Project

In this repo, I have post some of my machine learning assignment in which I mainly used scikit-learn and numpy to facilitate my work. Pandas was not used because there was not much data processing work. Besides, I had also written a file for Back-propagation without using machine learning library, though it is still under testing :)

1) zwang635-analysis2.pdf     This is the summary paper work of these codes
2) algo_decision_tree.py			Python file for decision tree
3) algo_boosting.py				    Python file for adaptive boosting
4) algo_neural_network.py		  Python file for neural network
5) algo_nn2.py				        Python file for neural network using Numpy and OOP
6) run_algo.py					      Main Python file to call different algorithms
7) poker and redwine_1			  Data sets
8) redwine_1.pdf				      Sample tree structure of decision tree algorithm
